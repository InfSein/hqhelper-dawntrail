### Application version

The version follows the rule of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` .

1. `MAJOR`,`MINOR`,`PATCH` are all positive integers;
2. `MAJOR` represents the generation of `HqHelper`, and also indicates the adapted version of the `Final Fantasy XIV` expansion pack;
3. `MINOR` represents the adapted `Final Fantasy XIV` medium version (e.g. the 1 of 7.1);
4. `PATCH` represents the version of the application under the aforementioned `MAJOR` and `MINOR` constraints.

For example, `2.1.17` represents:

- The `2nd` generation `HqHelper`, designed specifically for the `7.x` expansion version of `Final Fantasy XIV`;
- Adapt to the `1st` medium version of `Final Fantasy XIV`, which is version `7.1`;
- On the basis of adapting to version `7.1`, the `17th` version app updated.
